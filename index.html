								<h2>Collecting tools of creation</h2>
								<p>Designers and Developers solve different types of problems in different ways. But a problem in a design field need know no such boundary, so why only specialize in the type of problem you understand how to solve?  I desire to be able to solve any problem I come across during the development of my vision. So, by focusing on only learning the skills and patterns inherant in as many different fields of creation and problem solving as possible, and let memorization and calculation be automatically preformed, I find myself able to recognize macropatterns in human creation. I use that knowledge to synthesize cross-disciplinary solutions to problems. Solutions that, on average, closer to the absolute simplest possible solution given current technology.</p>

								<h2>Creative Creator</h2>
								<p>I am essentially an Artist who is good at math, loves soving problems, and has decided that the ideal intersection of all things I enjoy deepest, is found in engineering, design, science and music. Include nature, people and caffine, and you have a rudimentary list of things that define me and and what I have found bring me the most happiness and purpose in life.</p>
