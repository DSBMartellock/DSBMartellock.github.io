								<h2>My Goal: Only do work that I enjoy.</h2>
								<p>I love to automate. So if i am given a task that i find is tiresome or requires my attention but not my creative energy, I will automate that task.</br>
									My father Told me to never do the same job twice. This is echoed in basic computer sicence, "DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself"</br>
								What I have done so far is taken time to automate any portion of any task that I am given, because Automation gives you a hyper specialized tool to</br>
								Solve a problem or make an informed decision, with significantly less time input and uncertainty than otherwise allowable. </p>

								<h2>Creative Creator</h2>
								<p>I am essentially an Artist who is good at math, loves soving problems, and has decided that the ideal intersection of things I enjoy deepest, is </br>
								in engineering, design, science and music. Include nature, people and caffine, and you have a rudimentary list of things that define me and </br>
								and what I have found bring me the most happiness and purpose in life.</p>
