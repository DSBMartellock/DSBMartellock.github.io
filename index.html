								<h2>My Goal: Only do work that I enjoy.</h2>
								<p>I love to automate. So if i am given a task that i find is tiresome or requires my attention but not my creative energy, I will automate that task.</br>
									My father Told me to never do the same job twice. This is echoed in basic computer sicence, "DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself"</br>
								What I have done so far is taken time to automate any portion of any task that I am given, because Automation gives you a hyper specialized tool to</br>
								Solve a problem or make an informed decision, with significantly less time input and uncertainty than otherwise allowable. </p>

								<h2>Collecting tools of creation</h2>
								<p>Designers and Developers solve different types of problems in different ways. But a problem in a design field need know no such boundary, so why only specialize in the type of problem you understand how to solve?  I desire to be able to solve any problem I come across during the development of my vision. So, by focusing on only learning the skills and patterns inherant in as many different fields of creation and problem solving as possible, and let memorization and calculation be automatically preformed, I find myself able to recognize macropatterns in human creation. I use that knowledge to synthesize cross-disciplinary solutions to problems. Solutions that, on average, closer to the absolute simplest possible solution given current technology.</p>

								<h2>Creative Creator</h2>
								<p>I am essentially an Artist who is good at math, loves soving problems, and has decided that the ideal intersection of all things I enjoy deepest, is found in engineering, design, science and music. Include nature, people and caffine, and you have a rudimentary list of things that define me and and what I have found bring me the most happiness and purpose in life.</p>
